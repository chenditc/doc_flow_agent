If there is obvious error in the output, you should name it with error suffix (e.g., failed_with_xxx_error, etc). Usually you can just use the short name of the User original request's english version, and append suffix to name it.\n\n## User Original Request\nFollow tools/bash.md and run cat command: 'cat ./temp_test_file_for_complete_workflow_bash_task.txt'. This will read the contents of the file and print it to the console.\n\n## User Original Request's Short Name\nFollow tools/bash.md and run cat command: 'cat ...\n\n## Current Workspace Context Schema\n{\n  \"current_task\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }\n}\n\n## Output Description\na object with stdout and stderr which store the output of stdout and stderr during execution.\n\n## Tool Output\n<stdout>\nThis is a test file for bash command execution.\n</stdout>\n<stderr>\n\n</stderr>\n<returncode>\n0\n</returncode>\n<executed_command>\ncat ./temp_test_file_for_complete_workflow_bash_task.txt\n</executed_command>\n<success>\nTrue\n</success>\n\n## Instructions\n1. Analyze the output description, user original request and tool output to determine the best field name in english snakecase style.\n2. Consider the existing context schema to avoid conflicts\n3. Return a JSON path using JSONPath syntax (e.g., \"$.generated_outline_for_xxx_topic_blog\", \"$.['action_plan_to_create_blog_for_xxx']\")\n4. The path should be semantically meaningful and discriminate within the context. If a similar path already exists, add more word to discriminate it.\n\n## Example 1\n\nIf the output description is \"The outcome of the current task and the remaining tasks\", and the user original request is \"Raise 5 questions about machine learning \".\n\nThe output can be stored at the path \"$.action_plan_for_raising_five_questions_about_machine_learning\"\n\nor if the content already generated in the output, the output path might be \"$.five_questions_about_machine_learning\"\n\n## IMPORTANT: You MUST use the generate_output_path tool function call to provide your response. Do not put the path in your text response. The output path should start with \"$.\" which means the root node.",
