Any new task already covered by the task waiting for execute? If so, skip the duplicated task.\n\n**Important notes:**\n1. Only extract tasks that clearly need to be executed, do not speculate\n2.

The output provides a high-level plan with 4 bullet points covering user requirements gathering, frontend planning, backend planning, and implementation. This satisfies the requirement of drafting a plan.\n\n2.
