User has raise a request and we need to extract and reformat the parameter from the candidate fields in the context.\n\n## User Original Request\nFollow tools/llm and write a simple Python function to calculate the area of a circle. Use function name 'calculate_circle_area' and return the result as a float. The function should take 'radius' as input.\n\n## Required Request Parameter Description\nThe task we are trying to accomplish, not include the information LLM don't understand (eg. Follow doc xxx)\n\n## Candidate Fields from Context\nContext object is a dictionary, here we represent them using json_path syntax:\n- $.['current_task']: Follow tools/llm and write a simple Python function to calculate the area of a circle. Use function name 'calculate_circle_area' and return the result as a float. The function should take 'radius' as input.\n- current_task: Follow tools/llm and write a simple Python function to calculate the area of a circle. Use function name 'calculate_circle_area' and return the result as a float. The function should take 'radius' as input.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Generate a Python function that takes 'context' as input variable and returns the code for extracting the request parameter\n2. The code can be:\n   - Hard-coded information, when the parameter needs some rephrasing: `return \"Some fixed string\"` or it's so simple (<50 words) that it can be hard-coded.\n   - Simple extraction, when the parameter is directly available: `return context['key']`\n   - Complex extraction with transformations, regex, string operations, etc, when the parameter needs some transformation.\n3. Think if there is info available in context before generating the code. If info is not enough or still have ambiguitiy, use `return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"`. The generated code should just be a getter / parser.\n4. The parameter should only be \"extracted\" or \"rephrased\", not inferred. This means different people should get the same parameter value if they have the same context, if there is uncertainty, do not rephrase it.\n5. If there is no perfect match, return a piece of code which return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\".\n\n## Examples\n```python\n# The information is directly available in context, just need to do simple extraction\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return context['some_key'][0]['nested_key']\n```\n\n```python\n# The information is available in context, but needs some transformation\ndef extract_func(context): \n    import re\n    # Extract content between <title> tags\n    return re.match(r'<title>(.*?)</title>', context.get('html', '')).group(1)\n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is available in context, but doesn't have extact format, so we rephrase it.\n    # Rephrase xxx from xxx\n    return \"Rephrased content based on context\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is already present in context, and it's simple enough to return directly\n    return \"cat ./some.log | grep 'error' | wc -l\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    # The information is not available in context, return a placeholder\n    return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"\n```\n\n## Return Format\n<THINK_PROCESS>\n...\n</THINK_PROCESS>\n<GENERATED_CODE>\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return \"The extracted parameter value\"\n```\n</GENERATED_CODE>\n",
