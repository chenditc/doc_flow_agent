User has raise a request and we need to extract and reformat the parameter from the candidate fields in the context.\n\n## User Original Request\nGenerate a welcome message: Write a simple greeting message for a new user to school, less than 50 words. This is for a welcome screen.\n\n## Required Request Parameter Description\nAll related context that might be helpful to clarify the task or be used during task execution.\n\n## Candidate Fields from Context\nContext object is a dictionary, here we represent them using json_path syntax:\n- $.['current_task']: Generate a welcome message: Write a simple greeting message for a new user to school, less than 50 words. This is for a welcome screen.\n- current_task: Generate a welcome message: Write a simple greeting message for a new user to school, less than 50 words. This is for a welcome screen.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Generate a Python function that takes 'context' as input variable and returns the code for extracting the request parameter\n2. The code can be:\n   - Hard-coded information, when the parameter needs some rephrasing: `return \"Some fixed string\"` or it's so simple (<50 words) that it can be hard-coded.\n   - Simple extraction, when the parameter is directly available: `return context['key']`\n   - Complex extraction with transformations, regex, string operations, etc, when the parameter needs some transformation.\n3. Think if there is info available in context before generating the code. If info is not enough or still have ambiguitiy, use `return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"`. The generated code should just be a getter / parser.\n4. The parameter should only be \"extracted\" or \"rephrased\", not inferred. This means different people should get the same parameter value if they have the same context, if there is uncertainty, do not rephrase it.\n5. If there is no perfect match, return a piece of code which return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\".\n\n## Examples\n```python\n# The information is directly available in context, just need to do simple extraction\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return context['some_key'][0]['nested_key']\n```\n\n```python\n# The information is available in context, but needs some transformation\ndef extract_func(context): \n    import re\n    # Extract content between <title> tags\n    return re.match(r'<title>(.*?)</title>', context.get('html', '')).group(1)\n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is available in context, but doesn't have extact format, so we rephrase it.\n    # Rephrase xxx from xxx\n    return \"Rephrased content based on context\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is already present in context, and it's simple enough to return directly\n    return \"cat ./some.log | grep 'error' | wc -l\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    # The information is not available in context, return a placeholder\n    return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"\n```\n\n## Return Format\n<THINK_PROCESS>\n...\n</THINK_PROCESS>\n<GENERATED_CODE>\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return \"The extracted parameter value\"\n```\n</GENERATED_CODE>\n",

The message should be less than 50 words and suitable for display on a welcome screen.\n\n## Current Workspace Context Schema\n{\n  \"current_task\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  },\n  \"msg1_welcome_message_for_new_user_to_school\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  },\n  \"last_task_output\": {\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }\n}\n\n## Output Description\nThe output of large language model\n\n## Tool Output\nWelcome to our school! We're so excited to have you here. Get ready to learn, grow, and make wonderful memories. If you need anything, we're here to help. Have an amazing journey ahead! \ud83d\ude0a\n\n## Instructions\n1. Analyze the output description, user original request and tool output to determine the best field name in english snakecase style.\n2. Consider the existing context schema to avoid conflicts\n3. Return a JSON path using JSONPath syntax (e.g., \"$.generated_outline_for_xxx_topic_blog\", \"$.['action_plan_to_create_blog_for_xxx']\")\n4. The path should be semantically meaningful and discriminate within the context. If a similar path already exists, add more word to discriminate it.\n\n## Example 1\n\nIf the output description is \"The outcome of the current task and the remaining tasks\", and the user original request is \"Raise 5 questions about machine learning \".\n\nThe output can be stored at the path:\n```json\n{\n   \"output_path\": \"$.action_plan_for_raising_five_questions_about_machine_learning\"\n}\n```\n\nor if the content already generated in the output, the output path might be:\n```json\n{\n   \"output_path\": \"$.five_questions_about_machine_learning\"\n}\n```\n\n## Return Format (JSON only, no other text)\n{\n   \"output_path\": \"$.appropriate_path\"\n}",

Only extract tasks that clearly need to be executed, do not speculate\n2. Task descriptions should be clear and specific, include any background information if needed. Make sure the task is understandable without additional context. Keep the reference documentation path as it is.\n3. Ideally, we should have in the task description: \n - Why we need to do this: include any context like the current task description and how current task raised new task.\n - What is the expected output: what format or deliverable we expect.\n - How to do it: if there is reference documentation, include the path to it.\n4. There can be overlap between task description, make sure task description is comprehensive.\n5. You can use the original task description's language as your response language.\n\nPlease return the JSON array directly without any additional explanations.\n",
