User has raise a request and we need to extract and reformat the parameter from the candidate fields in the context.\n\n## User Original Request\nGenerate a welcome message: Write a simple greeting message for a new user to school, less than 50 words. This is for a welcome screen.\n\n## Required Request Parameter Description\nAll related context that might be helpful to clarify the task or be used during task execution.\n\n## Candidate Fields from Context\nContext object is a dictionary, here we represent them using json_path syntax:\n- $.['current_task']: Generate a welcome message: Write a simple greeting message for a new user to school, less than 50 words. This is for a welcome screen.\n- current_task: Generate a welcome message: Write a simple greeting message for a new user to school, less than 50 words. This is for a welcome screen.\n\n## Instructions\n1. Generate a Python function that takes 'context' as input variable and returns the code for extracting the request parameter\n2. The code can be:\n   - Hard-coded information, when the parameter needs some rephrasing: `return \"Some fixed string\"` or it's so simple (<50 words) that it can be hard-coded.\n   - Simple extraction, when the parameter is directly available: `return context['key']`\n   - Complex extraction with transformations, regex, string operations, etc, when the parameter needs some transformation.\n3. Think if there is info available in context before generating the code. If info is not enough or still have ambiguitiy, use `return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"`. The generated code should just be a getter / parser.\n4. The parameter should only be \"extracted\" or \"rephrased\", not inferred. This means different people should get the same parameter value if they have the same context, if there is uncertainty, do not rephrase it.\n5. If there is no perfect match, return a piece of code which return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\".\n6. If you rephrase the information, make sure you use the same language as the input_description.\n\n## Examples\n```python\n# The information is directly available in context, just need to do simple extraction\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return context['some_key'][0]['nested_key']\n```\n\n```python\n# The information is available in context, but needs some transformation\ndef extract_func(context): \n    import re\n    # Extract content between <title> tags\n    return re.match(r'<title>(.*?)</title>', context.get('html', '')).group(1)\n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is available in context, but doesn't have extact format, so we rephrase it.\n    # Rephrase xxx from xxx\n    return \"Rephrased content based on context\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is already present in context, and it's simple enough to return directly\n    return \"cat ./some.log | grep 'error' | wc -l\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    # The information is not available in context, return a placeholder\n    return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"\n```\n\n## Return Format\n<THINK_PROCESS>\n...\n</THINK_PROCESS>\n<GENERATED_CODE>\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return \"The extracted parameter value\"\n```\n</GENERATED_CODE>\n"

Generate a Python function that takes 'context' as input variable and returns the code for extracting the request parameter\n2. The code can be:\n   - Hard-coded information, when the parameter needs some rephrasing: `return \"Some fixed string\"` or it's so simple (<50 words) that it can be hard-coded.\n   - Simple extraction, when the parameter is directly available: `return context['key']`\n   - Complex extraction with transformations, regex, string operations, etc, when the parameter needs some transformation.\n3. Think if there is info available in context before generating the code. If info is not enough or still have ambiguitiy, use `return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"`. The generated code should just be a getter / parser.\n4. The parameter should only be \"extracted\" or \"rephrased\", not inferred. This means different people should get the same parameter value if they have the same context, if there is uncertainty, do not rephrase it.\n5. If there is no perfect match, return a piece of code which return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\".\n6. If you rephrase the information, make sure you use the same language as the input_description.\n\n## Examples\n```python\n# The information is directly available in context, just need to do simple extraction\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return context['some_key'][0]['nested_key']\n```\n\n```python\n# The information is available in context, but needs some transformation\ndef extract_func(context): \n    import re\n    # Extract content between <title> tags\n    return re.match(r'<title>(.*?)</title>', context.get('html', '')).group(1)\n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is available in context, but doesn't have extact format, so we rephrase it.\n    # Rephrase xxx from xxx\n    return \"Rephrased content based on context\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is already present in context, and it's simple enough to return directly\n    return \"cat ./some.log | grep 'error' | wc -l\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    # The information is not available in context, return a placeholder\n    return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"\n```\n\n## Return Format\n<THINK_PROCESS>\n...\n</THINK_PROCESS>\n<GENERATED_CODE>\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return \"The extracted parameter value\"\n```\n</GENERATED_CODE>\n"

Ask user for requirement on landing page, including layout, style, language.\n - Draft plan for frontend development.\n - Draft plan for backend development.\n - Implement frontend and backend site.\n</Task output content to analyze>\n\n<Task list waiting for execute>\nNo tasks waiting in queue\n</Task list waiting for execute>\n\nextract_new_tasks:\n  think process: \n\nLet me analyze the task output step by step:\n\n1. Is the output satisfy the current task requirement?\nThe current task was to \"Draft a plan for implementation\" of a landing page site for a small business company. The output provides a high-level plan with 4 bullet points covering user requirements gathering, frontend planning, backend planning, and implementation. This satisfies the requirement of drafting a plan.\n\n2. Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\nLooking at the output, I can see explicit tasks mentioned, but they are not intended for agent to execute. User just need a plan, but no need for agent.\n\ntasks: []\n</Example which should not output new task>\n\nIf you find new tasks that need to be executed, use the extract_new_tasks function to return them. If no new tasks are found, call the function with an empty task list.\n\nHere is the task that needs analysis:\n<Current task description>\nBackground: The current objective is to generate a welcome message (under 50 words) for a new user on a school welcome screen. The previous output defined a next step to use the LLM tool to produce this message.\n\nTask: Follow sop_docs/tools/llm.md, Write a single, concise welcome message for a new user on a school welcome screen.\n\nRequirements:\n- Length: fewer than 50 words.\n- Format: 1\u20132 sentences, plain text only (no emojis or special characters).\n- Tone: warm, inclusive, friendly, and professional.\n- Content: general (no specific school name), no calls-to-action, no jargon, at most one exclamation mark.\n- Deliverable: Provide exactly one message as plain text, no explanations.\n</Current task description>\n\n<SOP doc selected for this task>\n\n\n</SOP doc selected this task>\n\n<Task output content to analyze>\n<content>\nWelcome!
