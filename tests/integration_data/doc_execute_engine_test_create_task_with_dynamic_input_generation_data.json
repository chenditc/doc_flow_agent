Only use the tool if the tool is good at it, eg. LLM is good at non exact match, python is good at exact match. \n\nYou can complete almost anything using python + llm tool. Any task can be completed by using code to automate and use llm to think.\n\nAvailable tools:\n- tools/python: Generate and execute python code. It has access to data stored in context dictionary, usually reference by json path.\n  Use cases: Data processing, calculations, REST API calls, complex logic, file manipulation\n\n- tools/user_communicate: Use to send message to user and collect response. The message needs to be prepared before this step. This doc is not used to generate messasge.\n  Use cases: Use to send message to user and collect response. The message needs to be prepared before this step. This doc is not used to generate messasge.\n\n- tools/llm: General Large Language Model Text Generation\n  Use cases: Text analysis, content generation, writing, planning, reasoning tasks\n\n- tools/web_user_communicate: Use to collect user input through dynamically generated web forms. The LLM will analyze the instruction and create appropriate form fields (text, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.) automatically.\n  Use cases: Getting user input, asking questions, manual tasks requiring human intervention, use it very carefully, only ask user question when you are sure you need the user's input.\n\n- tools/web_result_delivery: Use to deliver task results to users through dynamically generated web pages. The LLM will create an appropriate result page based on the content type (text, JSON, files, images). Unlike WEB_USER_COMMUNICATE, this tool does not wait for user response and returns immediately.\n  Use cases: Use to deliver task results to users through dynamically generated web pages. The LLM will create an appropriate result page based on the content type (text, JSON, files, images). Unlike WEB_USER_COMMUNICATE, this tool does not wait for user response and returns immediately.\n\n- tools/bash: Execute any bash command or script in a sandbox environment. If user not mention which environment specifically, assume user meant for this environment.\n  Use cases: File operations, system commands, running scripts, installing packages\n\n\nGuidelines:\n- If the task already contain enough information to complete or we can provide good guess for missing information, then try to see if there is suitable tool to complete it in one go. Otherwise, the information can only be obtain from user, select 'tools/web_user_communicate' to ask for more information.\n- If the task can be completed in one step using a single tool, set can_complete_with_tool to true and select the appropriate tool\n- If the task If the task can be completed but it is complex and needs to be broken down into multiple steps, set can_complete_with_tool to false and select 'general/plan' \n- Consider the complexity, scope, and whether all necessary information is available.\n- If you select 'tools/web_user_communicate', you MUST provide a message_to_user that clearly explains what information is missing and asks the user to provide it.\n- Consider the information available from previously executed tasks when determining if enough information is available.\n\n<task to analyze>\nGenerate a welcome message: Write a simple greeting message for a new user to school, less than 50 words.

User has raise a request and we need to extract and reformat the parameter from the candidate fields in the context. \n\n## User Original Request\nGenerate a welcome message: Write a simple greeting message for a new user to school, less than 50 words. This is for a welcome screen.\n\n## Required Request Parameter Description\nThe prompt sending to LLM to complete the task, the prompt should be clear, concise, including all necessary information for LLM to generate output.\n\n## Candidate Fields from Context\nContext object is a dictionary, here we represent them using json_path syntax:\n<json path: $.['current_task'] type: <class 'str'>>\nGenerate a welcome message: Write a simple greeting message for a new user to school, less than 50 words. This is for a welcome screen.\n</json path: $.['current_task'] type: <class 'str'>>\n<json path: current_task type: <class 'str'>>\nGenerate a welcome message: Write a simple greeting message for a new user to school, less than 50 words. This is for a welcome screen.\n</json path: current_task type: <class 'str'>>\n\n## Instructions\n1. Generate a Python function that takes 'context' as input variable and returns the code for extracting the request parameter\n2. The code can be:\n   - Hard-coded information, when the parameter needs some rephrasing: `return \"Some fixed string\"` or it's so simple (<50 words) that it can be hard-coded.\n   - Simple extraction, when the parameter is directly available: `return context['key']`\n   - Complex extraction with transformations, regex, string operations, etc, when the parameter needs some transformation.\n3. Think if there is info available in context before generating the code. If info is not enough or still have ambiguitiy, use `return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"`. The generated code should just be a getter / parser.\n4. The parameter should only be \"extracted\" or \"rephrased\", not inferred. This means different people should get the same parameter value if they have the same context, if there is uncertainty, do not rephrase it.\n5. If there is no perfect match, return a piece of code which return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\".\n6. If you rephrase the information, make sure you use the same language as the input_description.\n7. Just generate the minimum required code, Eg. If there is no requirement to be structured, use plain text. Make sure the code has minimum possibility to fail.\n8. The returned parameter should satisfy the requirement from the ## Required Request Parameter Description\n\n## Examples\n```python\n# The information is directly available in context, just need to do simple extraction\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return context['some_key'][0]['nested_key']\n```\n\n```python\n# The information is available in context, but needs some transformation\ndef extract_func(context): \n    import re\n    # Extract content between <title> tags\n    return re.match(r'<title>(.*?)</title>', context.get('html', '')).group(1)\n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is available in context, but doesn't have extact format, so we rephrase it.\n    # Rephrase xxx from xxx\n    return \"Rephrased content based on context\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is already present in context, and it's simple enough to return directly\n    return \"cat ./some.log | grep 'error' | wc -l\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    # The information is not available in context, return a placeholder also explain why\n    return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>Cannot find xxx in xxx / Cannot parse xxx\"\n```\n\n## Return Format\n<THINK_PROCESS>\n...\n</THINK_PROCESS>\n<GENERATED_CODE>\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return \"The extracted parameter value\"\n```\n</GENERATED_CODE>\n",
