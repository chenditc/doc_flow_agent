If the output doesn't satisfy the current task requirement, generate tasks for agent to fix error on original one or finish the remaining task.\n\nPlease carefully analyze the output content and identify if it explicitly contains any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent.\n\n**Analysis process:**\n1. Is the output satisfy the current task requirement?\n2. Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\n3. Any new task already covered by the task waiting for execute? If so, skip the duplicated task.\n\n**Important notes:**\n1. Only extract tasks that clearly need to be executed, do not speculate\n2. Task descriptions should be clear and specific. Make sure the task is understandable without any additional context. Keep the reference documentation path as it is.\n3. Ideally, we should have in the task description: \n - Why we need to do this: include any context like the current task description and how current task raised new task.\n - What is the expected output: what format or deliverable we expect.\n - How to do it: if there is reference documentation, include the path to it.\n4. There can be overlap between task description, make sure task description is comprehensive.\n5. Please use the original task description's language as your response language.\n6. If the output doesn't satisfy the current task requirement, you can add more context to the original task description to help avoid the error or missing part.\n\n<Example which should output new task>\n\n<Current task description>\nWe need to implement a landing page site for small business company. Draft a plan for implementation for agents to execute.\n</Current task description>\n\n<Task output content to analyze>\nAgent should execute these tasks:\n - Follow user_communicate.md.

Is the output satisfy the current task requirement?\nThe current task was to \"Draft a plan for implementation for agents to execute\" for a landing page site. The output does provide a high-level plan with 4 specific tasks that agents should execute, so it does satisfy the requirement.\n\n2. Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\nYes, the output explicitly lists 4 tasks that \"Agent should execute\":\n- Follow user_communicate.md. Ask user for requirement on landing page, including layout, style, language.\n- Draft plan for frontend development.\n- Draft plan for backend development.\n- Implement frontend and backend site.\n\n3. Any new task already covered by the task waiting for execute? If so, skip the duplicated task.\n`Implement frontend and backend site.` is duplicate with the task waiting for execute. We should skip generate it as new task.\n\ntasks:\n[\n  \"Background: We are implementing a landing page site for small business company. We need to gather user requirements first.\n\nTask: Follow user_communicate.md documentation and ask user for requirements on landing page, including layout, style, and language preferences.\",\n  \"Background: We are implementing a landing page site for small business company.

In this step we need to create a detailed frontend development plan.\n\nTask: Draft a comprehensive plan for frontend development of the landing page site.\",\n  \"Background: We are implementing a landing page site for small business company.

Is the output satisfy the current task requirement?\nThe current task was to \"Draft a plan for implementation\" of a landing page site for a small business company. The output provides a high-level plan with 4 bullet points covering user requirements gathering, frontend planning, backend planning, and implementation. This satisfies the requirement of drafting a plan.\n\n2. Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\nLooking at the output, I can see explicit tasks mentioned, but they are not intended for agent to execute. User just need a plan, but no need for agent.\n\ntasks: []\n</Example which should not output new task>\n\nIf you find new tasks that need to be executed, use the extract_new_tasks function to return them. If no new tasks are found, call the function with an empty task list.\n\nHere is the task that needs analysis:\n<Current task description>\nList root directory contents using command: ls -la /\n</Current task description>\n\n<SOP doc selected for this task>\n\n\n\n\n\n</SOP doc selected this task>\n\n<Task output content to analyze>\n<stdout>\ntotal 2800\ndrwxr-xr-x  33 root root    4096 Sep 10 21:37 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  33 root root    4096 Sep 10 21:37 ..\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root root    4096 May 22 15:52 Docker\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root root       7 Apr 22  2024 bin -> usr/bin\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root    4096 Feb 26  2024 bin.usr-is-merged\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root    4096 Apr 22  2024 boot\ndrwxr-xr-x  15 root root    3880 Sep 14 09:39 dev\ndrwxr-xr-x  93 root root    4096 Sep 14 17:50 etc\ndrwxr-xr-x   3 root root    4096 May 22 15:42 home\n-rwxrwxrwx   1 root root 2724480 Jul 31 22:56 init\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root root       7 Apr 22  2024 lib -> usr/lib\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root    4096 Apr  8  2024 lib.usr-is-merged\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root root       9 Apr 22  2024 lib64 -> usr/lib64\ndrwx------   2 root root   16384 May 22 15:40 lost+found\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root    4096 Feb 15  2025 media\ndrwxr-xr-x   5 root root    4096 May 22 15:41 mnt\ndrwxr-xr-x   6 root root    4096 Jul  9 09:47 opt\ndr-xr-xr-x 389 root root       0 Sep 10 21:37 proc\ndrwx------   8 root root    4096 Sep 11 10:18 root\ndrwxr-xr-x  20 root root     660 Sep 14 09:21 run\nlrwxrwxrwx   1 root root       8 Apr 22  2024 sbin -> usr/sbin\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root    4096 Mar 31  2024 sbin.usr-is-merged\ndrwxr-xr-x   6 root root    4096 Jul  7 20:51 snap\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root root    4096 Feb 15  2025 srv\ndr-xr-xr-x  13 root root       0 Sep 12 15:00 sys\ndrwxrwxrwt  89 root root   12288 Sep 14 18:38 tmp\ndrwxr-xr-x  12 root root    4096 Feb 15  2025 usr\ndrwxr-xr-x  14 root root    4096 Jul  8 16:37 var\ndrwx------   2 root root    4096 May 25 10:08 wslAbPcam\ndrwx------   2 root root    4096 May 25 10:08 wslBGgNam\ndrwx------   2 root root    4096 Sep  5 09:52 wslabiPPh\ndrwx------   2 root root    4096 Sep  5 09:52 wslclOoFg\ndrwx------   2 root root    4096 Sep  5 09:52 wsleJEhah\ndrwx------   2 root root    4096 May 25 10:08 wslefgCam\ndrwx------   2 root root    4096 Sep  5 09:52 wsliAemah\ndrwx------   2 root root    4096 May 25 10:08 wslkdOAii\ndrwx------   2 root root    4096 May 25 10:08 wslklgkji\ndrwx------   2 root root    4096 Sep  5 09:52 wslpGnPah\n\n</stdout>\n<stderr>\n\n</stderr>\n<returncode>\n0\n</returncode>\n<executed_command>\nls -la /\n</executed_command>\n</Task output content to analyze>\n\n<Task list waiting for execute>\nNo tasks waiting in queue\n</Task list waiting for execute>\n",
