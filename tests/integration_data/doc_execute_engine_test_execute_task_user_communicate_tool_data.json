Only extract tasks that clearly and necessarily need to be executed next to achieve the intended deliverable, do not speculate.\n2. Task descriptions should be clear and specific. Make sure the task is understandable without any additional context. Keep reference documentation path as it is.\n3. If a reference doc is mentioned, include it in the task description.\n4. There can be overlap between task descriptions. Make sure each description is comprehensive and non-duplicative.\n5. Please use the original task description's language as your response language.\n6. If there is duplicate task with \"Task list waiting for execute\", skip the duplicated task and do not add it in tasks array.\n7. Do not add additional task requirement detailed if not explicitly specified.\n\nHere is the text that needs analysis:\n\n<Task output content to analyze>\n<question>\nCurrent task needs your help:\n\nPlease describe the main features you want in your new application\n</question>\n<user_reply>\nI want a simple todo list app with user authentication and task sharing capabilities\n</user_reply>\n</Task output content to analyze>\n\n<Task list waiting for execute>\nNo tasks waiting in queue\n</Task list waiting for execute>\n",
