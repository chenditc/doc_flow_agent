If the output doesn't satisfy the current task requirement, generate a new task for agent to fix error or complete the remaining parts.\n\nPlease carefully analyze the output content and identify if it explicitly contains any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent.\n\n**Analysis process:**\n1. Is the output satisfy the current task requirement?\n2. Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\n\n**Important notes:**\n1. Only extract tasks that clearly need to be executed, do not speculate\n2. Task descriptions should be clear and specific. Make sure the task is understandable without any additional context. Keep the reference documentation path as it is.\n3. Ideally, we should have in the task description: \n - Why we need to do this: include any context like the current task description and how current task raised new task.\n - What is the expected output: what format or deliverable we expect.\n - How to do it: if there is reference documentation, include the path to it.\n4. There can be overlap between task description, make sure task description is comprehensive.\n5. Please use the original task description's language as your response language.\n6. If the output doesn't satisfy the current task requirement, you can add more context to the original task description to help avoid the error or missing part.\n\n<Example which should output new task>\nCurrent Task: We need to implement a landing page site for small business company. Draft a plan for implementation for agents to execute.\nTask output: \nAgent should execute these tasks:\n - Follow user_communicate.md. Ask user for requirement on landing page, including layout, style, language.\n - Draft plan for frontend development.\n - Draft plan for backend development.\n - Implement frontend and backend site.\n\nextract_new_tasks:\n  think process: \n  \nLet me analyze the task output to see if it contains explicit follow-up tasks:\n\n1. Is the output satisfy the current task requirement?\nThe current task was to \"Draft a plan for implementation for agents to execute\" for a landing page site. The output does provide a high-level plan with 4 specific tasks that agents should execute, so it does satisfy the requirement.\n\n2. Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\nYes, the output explicitly lists 4 tasks that \"Agent should execute\":\n- Follow user_communicate.md. Ask user for requirement on landing page, including layout, style, language.\n- Draft plan for frontend development.\n- Draft plan for backend development.\n- Implement frontend and backend site.\n\ntasks:\n[\n  \"Background: We are implementing a landing page site for small business company and have drafted an implementation plan. The plan indicates we need to gather user requirements first.\n\nTask: Follow user_communicate.md documentation and ask user for requirements on landing page, including layout, style, and language preferences.\n\nExpected output: Clear documentation of user requirements covering layout preferences, visual style guidelines, and language specifications for the landing page.\n\nHow to do it: Follow the guidelines in user_communicate.md for proper user communication procedures.\",\n  \"Background: We are implementing a landing page site for small business company. After gathering user requirements, we need to create a detailed frontend development plan.\n\nTask: Draft a comprehensive plan for frontend development of the landing page site.\n\nExpected output: A detailed frontend development plan that includes technology stack, component structure, responsive design approach, and implementation timeline.\n\nHow to do it: Based on the user requirements gathered, create a structured plan covering all frontend development aspects.\",\n  \"Background: We are implementing a landing page site for small business company. Along with frontend, we need to plan the backend infrastructure and functionality.\n\nTask: Draft a comprehensive plan for backend development of the landing page site.\n\nExpected output: A detailed backend development plan including server architecture, database design (if needed), API endpoints, hosting requirements, and security considerations.\n\nHow to do it: Design backend architecture that supports the landing page functionality and integrates well with the frontend plan.\",\n  \"Background: We are implementing a landing page site for small business company. After completing the planning phase, we need to build the actual website.\n\nTask: Implement both frontend and backend components of the landing page site according to the drafted plans.\n\nExpected output: A fully functional landing page website with both frontend user interface and backend infrastructure deployed and ready for use.\n\nHow to do it: Follow the frontend and backend development plans created in previous tasks to build and deploy the complete landing page site.\"\n]\n</Example which should output new task>\n\n<Example which should not output new task>\nCurrent Task: We need to implement a landing page site for small business company. Draft a plan for implementation.\nTask output: \nHere is a plan:\n - Follow user_communicate.md. Ask user for requirement on landing page, including layout, style, language.\n - Draft plan for frontend development.\n - Draft plan for backend development.\n - Implement frontend and backend site.\n\nextract_new_tasks:\n  think process: \n\nLet me analyze the task output step by step:\n\n1. Is the output satisfy the current task requirement?\nThe current task was to \"Draft a plan for implementation\" of a landing page site for a small business company. The output provides a high-level plan with 4 bullet points covering user requirements gathering, frontend planning, backend planning, and implementation. This satisfies the requirement of drafting a plan.\n\n2. Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\nLooking at the output, I can see explicit tasks mentioned, but they are not intended for agent to execute. User just need a plan, but no need for agent.\n\ntasks: []\n</Example which should not output new task>\n\nIf you find new tasks that need to be executed, use the extract_new_tasks function to return them. If no new tasks are found, call the function with an empty task list.\n\nHere is the task that needs analysis:\n<Current task description>\nAsk user for project requirements.
