We need to run a command and command not exists. Or if we need to write a paragraph and no text outputed.\n2. If requirements are NOT met, list specific failing aspects and create new tasks to address them, so that user's end goal can be achieved. If there are multiple failing aspect and only some of them are root cause, you should only generate new task to address root cause. You should NOT generate new task to address non-root-cause issue or issue you are not confirmed.\n3.
