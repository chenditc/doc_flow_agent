Only return the explicit task, do not infer task by yourself. If there are explicitly stated new tasks for agent, please return them in the following json format:\n\n**Format requirements:**\n- If no new tasks, return:\n<THINK_PROCESS>\n1. Is the output satisfy the current task requirement?\n2. Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\n</THINK_PROCESS>\n<FINAL_CONFLUSION>\n```json\n[]\n```\n</FINAL_CONFLUSION>\n\n- If new tasks exist, return JSON array format: \n<THINK_PROCESS>\n1.

Only extract tasks that clearly need to be executed, do not speculate\n2. Task descriptions should be clear and specific, include any background information if needed. Make sure the task is understandable without additional context. Keep the reference documentation path as it is.\n3. Ideally, we should have in the task description: \n - Why we need to do this: include any context like the current task description and how current task raised new task.\n - What is the expected output: what format or deliverable we expect.\n - How to do it: if there is reference documentation, include the path to it.\n4. There can be overlap between task description, make sure task description is comprehensive.\n5. You can use the original task description's language as your response language.\n\nPlease return the JSON array directly without any additional explanations.\n",
