Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\n\n**Important notes:**\n1. Only extract tasks that clearly need to be executed, do not speculate\n2. Task descriptions should be clear and specific, include any background information if needed. Make sure the task is understandable without additional context. Keep the reference documentation path as it is.\n3. Ideally, we should have in the task description: \n - Why we need to do this: include any context like the current task description and how current task raised new task.\n - What is the expected output: what format or deliverable we expect.\n - How to do it: if there is reference documentation, include the path to it.\n4. There can be overlap between task description, make sure task description is comprehensive.\n5. Please use the original task description's language as your response language.\n\nIf you find new tasks that need to be executed, use the extract_new_tasks function to return them. If no new tasks are found, call the function with an empty task list.\n",

The output shows the user replied with specific requirements: \"I want a simple todo list app with user authentication and task sharing capabilities\". This satisfies the current task requirement.\n\n2. **Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?**\n   No, the output only contains the user's response to the requirements question. There are no explicit instructions or indications in the output that specify follow-up tasks the agent needs to execute. The user simply provided their requirements as requested, but did not explicitly ask for any specific next steps to be performed.\n\nSince the output only contains the user's response to the requirements gathering question and does not explicitly indicate any follow-up tasks that need to be executed by the agent, I will return an empty task list.",
