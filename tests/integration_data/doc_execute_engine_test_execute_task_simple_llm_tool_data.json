You are receiving root task description to execute, and you have performed some work for it. Your work's output is provided in aggregated_outputs.\n\nRight now, you need to evaluate whether your work has satisfied the root task requirements. \n\n1. First, you need to think about what to check based on the requirement evaluation rule. If no requirement evaluation rule present then consider the task description. If requirement evaluation rule is present, do not use any other evaluation rule. Only consider requirement not met if some requirement totally missed. Eg. We need to run a command and command not exists. Or if we need to write a paragraph and no text outputed. Start your think process by \"The requirement evaluation rule is ....\"\n2. If requirements are NOT met, list specific failing aspects and create new tasks to address them, so that user's end goal can be achieved. If there are multiple failing aspect and only some of them are root cause, you should only generate new task to address root cause. You should NOT generate new task to address non-root-cause issue or issue you are not confirmed. When you generate a retry task, make sure you use the same reference document as the original subtask.\n3. If requirements ARE met, provide a summary and which path in the aggregated_outputs should be used to consider as the deliverable output, put the json path as it is in the deliverable_output_path parameter. The deliverable_output_path should contains only the deliverable information, eg. if root task is asking a summary of an article, the deliverable_output_path should only contain summary, not including other thinking or execution process like download article or parse article. If the deliverable content is nested, you can access it like $.some_output_path.some_json_field_in_that_output. If there are multiple deliverable, include all paths. If all sub path are important, use the root path.\n\nUse the evaluate_and_summarize_subtree function to provide your evaluation.\n</instructions>\n\n<root_task_description>Write a command which can list out the contents of the home directory.
