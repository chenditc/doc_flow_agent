Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\n\n**Important notes:**\n1. Only extract tasks that clearly need to be executed, do not speculate\n2. Task descriptions should be clear and specific, include any background information if needed. Make sure the task is understandable without additional context. Keep the reference documentation path as it is.\n3. Ideally, we should have in the task description: \n - Why we need to do this: include any context like the current task description and how current task raised new task.\n - What is the expected output: what format or deliverable we expect.\n - How to do it: if there is reference documentation, include the path to it.\n4. There can be overlap between task description, make sure task description is comprehensive.\n5. Please use the original task description's language as your response language.\n\nIf you find new tasks that need to be executed, use the extract_new_tasks function to return them. If no new tasks are found, call the function with an empty task list.\n",

However, there's no command for listing home directory contents in the output.\n\n2. **Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?**\n   Looking at the output content, it's a well-formatted welcome message with sections like \"What's Next?\" and \"Need Help?\". However, the output does not explicitly mention any specific follow-up tasks that need to be executed by the agent. The content describes general next steps for users (explore, get started, connect, learn) but these are suggestions for the users themselves, not tasks for the agent to execute.\n\nThe output does not contain any explicit instructions or requests for the agent to perform additional tasks. The welcome message is complete and self-contained.",
