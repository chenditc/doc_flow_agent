If the output doesn't satisfy the current task requirement, generate tasks for agent to fix error on original one or finish the remaining task.\n\nPlease carefully analyze the output content and identify if it explicitly contains any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent.\n\n**Analysis process:**\n1. Is the output satisfy the current task requirement?\n2. Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\n3. Any new task already covered by the task waiting for execute? If so, skip the duplicated task.\n\n**Important notes:**\n1. Only extract tasks that clearly need to be executed, do not speculate\n2. Task descriptions should be clear and specific. Make sure the task is understandable without any additional context. Keep the reference documentation path as it is.\n3. If a reference doc is mentioned, include it in task description.\n4. There can be overlap information between task description, make sure task description is comprehensive.\n5. Please use the original task description's language as your response language.\n6. If the output doesn't satisfy the current task requirement, you can add more context to the original task description to help avoid the error or missing part.\n\n<Example which should output new task>\n\n<Current task description>\nWe need to implement a landing page site for small business company.

Is the output satisfy the current task requirement?\nThe current task was to \"Draft a plan for implementation for agents to execute\" for a landing page site. The output does provide a high-level plan with 4 specific tasks that agents should execute, so it does satisfy the requirement.\n\n2. Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\nYes, the output explicitly lists 4 tasks that \"Agent should execute\":\n- Follow user_communicate.md. Ask user for requirement on landing page, including layout, style, language.\n- Draft plan for frontend development.\n- Draft plan for backend development.\n- Implement frontend and backend site.\n\n3. Any new task already covered by the task waiting for execute? If so, skip the duplicated task.\n`Implement frontend and backend site.` is duplicate with the task waiting for execute. We should skip generate it as new task.\n\ntasks:\n[\n  \"Follow user_communicate.md documentation and ask user for requirements on landing page, including layout, style, and language preferences.\",\n  \"Draft a comprehensive plan for frontend development of the landing page site.\",\n  \"Draft a comprehensive plan for backend development of the landing page site.\"\n]\n</Example which should output new task>\n\n<Example which should not output new task>\n\n<Current task description>\nWe need to implement a landing page site for small business company.

Is the output satisfy the current task requirement?\nThe current task was to \"Draft a plan for implementation\" of a landing page site for a small business company. The output provides a high-level plan with 4 bullet points covering user requirements gathering, frontend planning, backend planning, and implementation. This satisfies the requirement of drafting a plan.\n\n2. Does the output indicate any follow-up tasks that explicitly needed to be executed by agent?\nLooking at the output, I can see explicit tasks mentioned, but they are not intended for agent to execute. User just need a plan, but no need for agent.\n\ntasks: []\n</Example which should not output new task>\n\nIf you find new tasks that need to be executed, use the extract_new_tasks function to return them. If no new tasks are found, call the function with an empty task list.\n\nHere is the task that needs analysis:\n\n<Current task description>\nWrite a command which can list out the contents of the home directory.
