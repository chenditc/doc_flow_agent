The message needs to be prepared before this step. This doc is not used to generate messasge.\n  Use cases: Getting user input, asking questions, manual tasks requiring human intervention\n\n- tools/bash: Execute any bash command or script in a sandbox environment. If user not mention which environment specifically, assume user meant for this environment.\n  Use cases: File operations, system commands, running scripts, installing packages\n\n- tools/python: Generate and execute python code. It has access to data stored in context dictionary, usually reference by json path.\n  Use cases: Data processing, calculations, API calls, complex logic, file manipulation\n\n- tools/llm: General Large Language Model Text Generation\n  Use cases: Text analysis, content generation, writing, planning, reasoning tasks\n\n\nGuidelines:\n- If the task already contain enough information to complete or we can provide good guess for missing information, then try to see if there is suitable tool to complete it in one go. Otherwise, the information can only be obtain from user, select 'tools/user_communicate' to ask for more information.\n- If the task can be completed in one step using a single tool, set can_complete_with_tool to true and select the appropriate tool\n- If the task If the task can be completed but it is complex and needs to be broken down into multiple steps, set can_complete_with_tool to false and select 'general/plan' \n- Consider the complexity, scope, and whether all necessary information is available.\n- If you select 'tools/user_communicate', you MUST provide a message_to_user that clearly explains what information is missing and asks the user to provide it.\n\n<task to analyze>\nGenerate a simple greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - keep it exactly like this\n</task to analyze>\n\nPlease use the select_tool_for_task function to provide your analysis.\n",

User has raise a request and we need to extract and reformat the parameter from the candidate fields in the context.\n\n## User Original Request\nGenerate a simple greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - keep it exactly like this\n\n## Required Request Parameter Description\nThe prompt sending to LLM to complete the task, the prompt should be clear, concise, including all necessary information for LLM to generate output.\n\n## Candidate Fields from Context\nContext object is a dictionary, here we represent them using json_path syntax:\n<json path: $.['current_task'] type: <class 'str'>>\nGenerate a simple greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - keep it exactly like this\n</json path: $.['current_task'] type: <class 'str'>>\n<json path: current_task type: <class 'str'>>\nGenerate a simple greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - keep it exactly like this\n</json path: current_task type: <class 'str'>>\n\n## Instructions\n1. Generate a Python function that takes 'context' as input variable and returns the code for extracting the request parameter\n2. The code can be:\n   - Hard-coded information, when the parameter needs some rephrasing: `return \"Some fixed string\"` or it's so simple (<50 words) that it can be hard-coded.\n   - Simple extraction, when the parameter is directly available: `return context['key']`\n   - Complex extraction with transformations, regex, string operations, etc, when the parameter needs some transformation.\n3. Think if there is info available in context before generating the code. If info is not enough or still have ambiguitiy, use `return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"`. The generated code should just be a getter / parser.\n4. The parameter should only be \"extracted\" or \"rephrased\", not inferred. This means different people should get the same parameter value if they have the same context, if there is uncertainty, do not rephrase it.\n5. If there is no perfect match, return a piece of code which return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\".\n6. If you rephrase the information, make sure you use the same language as the input_description.\n7. Just generate the minimum required code, Eg. If there is no requirement to be structured, use plain text. Make sure the code has minimum possibility to fail.\n\n## Examples\n```python\n# The information is directly available in context, just need to do simple extraction\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return context['some_key'][0]['nested_key']\n```\n\n```python\n# The information is available in context, but needs some transformation\ndef extract_func(context): \n    import re\n    # Extract content between <title> tags\n    return re.match(r'<title>(.*?)</title>', context.get('html', '')).group(1)\n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is available in context, but doesn't have extact format, so we rephrase it.\n    # Rephrase xxx from xxx\n    return \"Rephrased content based on context\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is already present in context, and it's simple enough to return directly\n    return \"cat ./some.log | grep 'error' | wc -l\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    # The information is not available in context, return a placeholder also explain why\n    return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>Cannot find xxx in xxx / Cannot parse xxx\"\n```\n\n## Return Format\n<THINK_PROCESS>\n...\n</THINK_PROCESS>\n<GENERATED_CODE>\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return \"The extracted parameter value\"\n```\n</GENERATED_CODE>\n",
