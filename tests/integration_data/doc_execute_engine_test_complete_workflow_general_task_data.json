User has raise a request and we need to extract and reformat the parameter from the candidate fields in the context.\n\n## User Original Request\nGenerate a simple greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - keep it exactly like this\n\n## Required Request Parameter Description\nAll related context that might be helpful to clarify the task or be used during task execution.\n\n## Candidate Fields from Context\nContext object is a dictionary, here we represent them using json_path syntax:\n- $.['current_task']: Generate a simple greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - keep it exactly like this\n- current_task: Generate a simple greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - keep it exactly like this\n\n## Instructions\n1. Generate a Python function that takes 'context' as input variable and returns the code for extracting the request parameter\n2. The code can be:\n   - Hard-coded information, when the parameter needs some rephrasing: `return \"Some fixed string\"` or it's so simple (<50 words) that it can be hard-coded.\n   - Simple extraction, when the parameter is directly available: `return context['key']`\n   - Complex extraction with transformations, regex, string operations, etc, when the parameter needs some transformation.\n3. Think if there is info available in context before generating the code. If info is not enough or still have ambiguitiy, use `return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"`. The generated code should just be a getter / parser.\n4. The parameter should only be \"extracted\" or \"rephrased\", not inferred. This means different people should get the same parameter value if they have the same context, if there is uncertainty, do not rephrase it.\n5. If there is no perfect match, return a piece of code which return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\".\n\n## Examples\n```python\n# The information is directly available in context, just need to do simple extraction\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return context['some_key'][0]['nested_key']\n```\n\n```python\n# The information is available in context, but needs some transformation\ndef extract_func(context): \n    import re\n    # Extract content between <title> tags\n    return re.match(r'<title>(.*?)</title>', context.get('html', '')).group(1)\n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is available in context, but doesn't have extact format, so we rephrase it.\n    # Rephrase xxx from xxx\n    return \"Rephrased content based on context\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is already present in context, and it's simple enough to return directly\n    return \"cat ./some.log | grep 'error' | wc -l\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    # The information is not available in context, return a placeholder\n    return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"\n```\n\n## Return Format\n<THINK_PROCESS>\n...\n</THINK_PROCESS>\n<GENERATED_CODE>\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return \"The extracted parameter value\"\n```\n</GENERATED_CODE>\n",

Examine the candidate fields in the context:\n   - Both `$.['current_task']` and `current_task` in the context have the exact string: `\"Generate a simple greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - keep it exactly like this\"`.\n   - The greeting message is explicitly stated in the user request and matches the context.\n4.

The tool already have all the input it needs. Generate one new_task_to_execute_1 object.\n\n#### Case 2\nIf you need additional information or the task is too big to complete in one go, please break down the task into multiple sub tasks, each sub task should be clear and include all required information. Generate multiple new_task_to_execute_x object.\n\n#### Case 3\nIf there are certain tool that can be used to complete the task but it's not listed in the tools section, you can use 'user_communicate' tool to send the detailed instruction for using that tool and consider this task as completed. Generate one new_task_to_execute_1 object starting with 'Follow user_communicate.md to xxxx'\n\n#### Tools\n 1. cli tool: \n    - Functionality: You have a ubuntu 24.04 sandbox and you can execute any command in a bash terminal, you just need to provide the bash command as input, the tool will send back the stdout and stderr result. \n    - Input for tool: A comprehensive bash command or script.\n    - Trigger prefix: To use cli tool, add this to the task description: \"Follow sop_docs/tools/bash.md,\".\n 2. llm tool: \n    - Functionality: You can prompt a large language model to generate text, you can make it draft content, generate plan, generate code and etc. The tool will send back text result. \n    - Input for tool: A detailed instruction prompt for llm.\n    - Trigger prefix: To use llm tool, add this to the task description: \"Follow sop_docs/tools/llm.md,\".\n 3. user_communicate tool: \n    - Functionality: You can give text to user and let user to do actual work, eg, operate machine / browser / software. The tool will collect user's feedback and let you know if the instruction has been completed. \n    - Input for tool: A prepared message to send to user.\n    - Trigger prefix: To use user_communicate tool, add this to the task description: \"Follow sop_docs/tools/user_communicate.md,\". \n\n#### Sub task requirement\n - Each sub task description will be fan out to different domain expert to execute, domain expert doesn't know the context of the task, so make sure the task description contains all information.\n - You can rephrase the sub task to make it sounds natural and professional.\n\n<USER_TASK>\nGenerate a simple greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - keep it exactly like this\n</USER_TASK>\n\n<TASK_CONTEXT>\nHello, welcome to our platform!\n</TASK_CONTEXT>",
