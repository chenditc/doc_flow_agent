User has raise a request and we need to extract and reformat the parameter from the candidate fields in the context.\n\n## User Original Request\nGenerate a simple greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - keep it exactly like this\n\n## Required Request Parameter Description\nAll related context that might be helpful to clarify the task or be used during task execution.\n\n## Candidate Fields from Context\nContext object is a dictionary, here we represent them using json_path syntax:\n- $.['current_task']: Generate a simple greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - keep it exactly like this\n- current_task: Generate a simple greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - keep it exactly like this\n\n## Instructions\n1. Generate a Python function that takes 'context' as input variable and returns the code for extracting the request parameter\n2. The code can be:\n   - Hard-coded information, when the parameter needs some rephrasing: `return \"Some fixed string\"` or it's so simple (<50 words) that it can be hard-coded.\n   - Simple extraction, when the parameter is directly available: `return context['key']`\n   - Complex extraction with transformations, regex, string operations, etc, when the parameter needs some transformation.\n3. Think if there is info available in context before generating the code. If info is not enough or still have ambiguitiy, use `return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"`. The generated code should just be a getter / parser.\n4. The parameter should only be \"extracted\" or \"rephrased\", not inferred. This means different people should get the same parameter value if they have the same context, if there is uncertainty, do not rephrase it.\n5. If there is no perfect match, return a piece of code which return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\".\n6. If you rephrase the information, make sure you use the same language as the input_description.\n\n## Examples\n```python\n# The information is directly available in context, just need to do simple extraction\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return context['some_key'][0]['nested_key']\n```\n\n```python\n# The information is available in context, but needs some transformation\ndef extract_func(context): \n    import re\n    # Extract content between <title> tags\n    return re.match(r'<title>(.*?)</title>', context.get('html', '')).group(1)\n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is available in context, but doesn't have extact format, so we rephrase it.\n    # Rephrase xxx from xxx\n    return \"Rephrased content based on context\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context): \n    # The information is already present in context, and it's simple enough to return directly\n    return \"cat ./some.log | grep 'error' | wc -l\" \n```\n\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    # The information is not available in context, return a placeholder\n    return \"<NOT_FOUND_IN_CANDIDATES>\"\n```\n\n## Return Format\n<THINK_PROCESS>\n...\n</THINK_PROCESS>\n<GENERATED_CODE>\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    return \"The extracted parameter value\"\n```\n</GENERATED_CODE>\n"

User Original Request: \"Follow sop_docs/tools/llm.md, generate the exact greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - output this text exactly as specified without any modifications, additions, or formatting changes.\"\n\n2. Required Request Parameter Description: \"The task we are trying to accomplish, not include the information LLM don't understand (eg. Follow doc xxx)\"\n\nSo I need to extract the core task while removing the reference to \"Follow sop_docs/tools/llm.md\" since that's something the LLM doesn't understand.\n\nLooking at the candidate fields:\n- $.current_task contains the full original request\n- $.msg1_action_plan_for_generating_platform_greeting_message.content and $.last_task_output.content contain analysis but still include the \"Follow sop_docs/tools/llm.md\" part in the new_task_to_execute_1 section\n- current_task also contains the full original request\n\nThe core task is to \"generate the exact greeting message: 'Hello, welcome to our platform!' - output this text exactly as specified without any modifications, additions, or formatting changes.\"\n\nI need to remove the \"Follow sop_docs/tools/llm.md\" part and keep only the actual task description. This requires some string manipulation to extract the relevant part.\n</THINK_PROCESS>\n\n<GENERATED_CODE>\n```python\ndef extract_func(context):\n    # Extract the task description, removing the document reference that LLM doesn't understand\n    original_task = context.get('current_task', '')\n    \n    # Remove the \"Follow sop_docs/tools/llm.md, \" part and keep the actual task\n    if original_task.startswith('Follow sop_docs/tools/llm.md, '):\n        return original_task[len('Follow sop_docs/tools/llm.md, '):]\n    else:\n        return original_task\n```\n</GENERATED_CODE>",
